# Microsoft Azure BootCamp
Repository for source and slides related to the North Houston instance of the 2016 Global Azure Bootcamp, sponsored by InfoCraft and CODE Training.

The slides were originally published by Microsoft at [http://aka.ms/azure-devcamp](http://aka.ms/azure-devcamp). They were modified _slightly_ by Joseph Reynolds in preparation for presentation at the Azure Bootcamp. Many thanks are due to the folks who managed to pull together the originals.

Use of the installer is recommended, either from within this repository, or at [http://aka.ms/azure-devcamp](http://aka.ms/azure-devcamp).
